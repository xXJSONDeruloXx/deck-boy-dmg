A Steam Deck plugin that brings Game Boy emulation directly to your Steam Deck's plugin panel. Built with [decky-frontend-lib](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-frontend-lib) and powered by the [@neil-morrison44/gameboy-emulator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neil-morrison44/gameboy-emulator) library.

üöß **In Progress**: ROM file loading, filesystem integration  
‚è≥ **Planned**: Steam Deck input mapping, save state persistence, ROM directory scanning  

## Architecture

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript with @decky/ui components  
**Backend**: Python with decky plugin system  
**Emulator**: @neil-morrison44/gameboy-emulator library  
**Build**: Rollup bundler with @decky/rollup configuration  

### Key Components

- **GameBoyEmulator Component**: Handles the 160x144 canvas display
- **ROMSelector Component**: ROM file selection interface
- **EmulatorControls Component**: Play/pause/reset and save state controls

## Installation

### For Users

1. Install [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) on your Steam Deck
2. Download the latest release zip from the releases page
3. Install via Decky Loader's plugin installer

### For Developers

#### Dependencies

This project relies on Node.js v16.14+ and `pnpm` (v9) installed on your system.  
Please make sure to install pnpm v9 to prevent issues with CI during plugin submission.  

#### Linux

```bash
sudo npm i -g pnpm@9
```

#### Setup & Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/deck-boy-dmg.git
   cd deck-boy-dmg
   ```

2. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   pnpm run build
   ```

3. For development with file watching:
   ```bash
   pnpm run watch
   ```

4. If using VSCode/VSCodium, run the `setup`, `build` and `deploy` tasks for streamlined development.

### Game Boy ROMs

Place your Game Boy ROM files (.gb, .gbc) in:
```
/home/deck/GameBoyROMs/
```

The plugin will scan this directory for available ROMs to load.

### Development Notes

Everytime you change the frontend code (`src/index.tsx`, components, etc.) you will need to rebuild using `pnpm run build` or the build task if you're using VSCode.

If you encounter build errors due to an out of date library, run:
```bash
pnpm update @decky/ui --latest
```
