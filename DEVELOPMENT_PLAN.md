# Deck Boy DMG - Game Boy Emulator Plugin Development Plan

## Project Overview
Create a Steam Deck plugin that integrates the gameboy.js emulator library to provide Game Boy emulation directly within the Steam Deck interface. The plugin will display the Game Boy screen within the plugin panel and load ROMs from a specific directory.

## Research Summary

### Current Plugin Template Structure
- **Framework**: Decky Loader plugin system
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React with @decky/ui components  
- **Build System**: Rollup for bundling
- **Entry Point**: `src/index.tsx`
- **Configuration**: `plugin.json` for metadata
- **Backend Support**: Python backend available in `backend/` directory

### Gameboy.js Library Analysis
- **Main Class**: `GameboyJS.Gameboy(canvas, options)`
- **Display**: Renders to HTML5 Canvas (160x144 Game Boy resolution)
- **ROM Loading**: Multiple readers (File, AJAX, Drag & Drop)
- **Input**: Built-in keyboard/gamepad mapping system
- **Audio**: Web Audio API (quality varies by browser)
- **Saves**: localStorage for game save data
- **Controls**: A, B, START, SELECT + D-pad mapping
